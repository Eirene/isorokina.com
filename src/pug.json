        "mdContent": "<div class=\"well well--warning\">\n  <p>\n  Disclaimer: My blog is focused on developers who want to start doing their own projects. For shy tech geeks like myself. And it's SaaS-focused mostly. I guess you got the idea.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n## Who is this article for?\nYou built dozens of applications for your clients and you are guessing what to do with the experience collected along the way.  \nYou may have started dreaming about starting your own startup. Your big thing. Your rules, no more confusing tasks from your clients.  \nYou even have your notes with ideas of what you can build.\nYou are basically all set for your personal sailing.  \nWhat's next?  \n\n## What is this article about?\n In this article, I'll share my approach to shipping an app idea. Its built on top of mistakes I made myself and ones I observed while working with my freelance clients.  \nThis article is focused to motivate you to start. Just to start, but at any cost.  \nIn future articles, I'll cover marketing, fundraising, technical infrastructure, and other topics important for the next steps.\n\n## What to build?\nIt may sound weird, but you may not need a planet-size idea / game-changer app / or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/B8C5sjjhsso\" target=\"_blank\">to make a world a better place</a>.\n\n> Sometimes all you need is just to help a group of people to get rid of their **small itch**. \n\nIt can be something as small and simple as making a good <a href=\"https://inkdrop.app/\" target=\"_blank\">markdown editor</a>, a user <a href=\"https://www.upvoty.com/\" target=\"_blank\">feedback platform</a>, or a <a href=\"https://www.saaspegasus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">saas boilerplate</a>.\nMany apps our days are overweighted with too many features and overwhelming UI. Sometimes all you need to withstand your competitors is a high-quality product and a minimalistic approach.  \nKeeping things small will let you build a meaningful solution faster, aim at your core audience easier and focus on what matters for MVP.\n\n![You can't screw up too much if you do something small](/img/blog/ship-it-today/keep-it-small.webp)\n\nNote that when you start thinking about what \"idea\" to implement - you draw castles in the air - \"good to have\" things, but unreal or useless. \nIn opposite - when you think about \"what pain can I solve\" - your focus is on a real issue, that hurts someone every day.\n\nIdeally, you choose something that is your personal itch. Something that you understand, something that you can judge if it solves the issue or not. When you work with your own pain - you don't need a group of testers. You are your best tester. You are part of your core audience. You can see the problem from the inside, instead of guessing about other people's pain.\n\nOk, so you've chosen what to build (great if you did some research about competitors first) and you are ready for next step - implement your solution.\n\n## How to build it?\nYou need to think about the features of your solution and what building blocks they will require. From design to frontend, to backend, to architecture. Diving into each will easily go beyond this article's borders, so let's define the core principles.\n\n1. Keep it as simple as possible in the beginning. That will let you move fast and change directions quickly during experimentation.\n2. Stick with your stack. The technology stack doesn't matter much now. You'll alter it multiple times in the future. Just start with whatever stack you are familiar with the most.\n3. Let it be **not perfect**. You'll most probably change the form of your solution multiple times before it stabilizes in the form that works. Then you can polish it.\n\nLet's look at each principle deeper.\n\n### Keep it simple stupid\nYou don't need complications at this stage. Things like linting, unit-/e2e- tests, and CI/CD automation are best practices, but for a later stage. Do not let yourself drown in setting up everything for production. Remember that right now you just need to start. Once you have started and published something - you can go step by step to improve your dev workflow. Where it makes sense. When it makes sense. \n\n### Stick with your stack\nTo start you don't need to learn <a href=\"http://vanilla-js.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\"yet another fancy JS framework\"</a> (although it can be tempting and be an incentive to start). Just take your favorite stack, the thing you are the most experienced with. Sometimes you may get stuck thinking that your old bro [put your stack name here] is not good enough. Leave such thoughts away. You'll change it later. Maybe. Or maybe never. In any case, your end users do not care which tech you use if your solution solves their issue.\n\n![Use what you are experienced with](/img/blog/ship-it-today/use-what-you-are-experienced-with.webp)  \nIn one of my future articles, I'll share a technical stack that I use for my projects.\n\n### Let it be not perfect\nPerfectionism can block you from ever shipping.  \nMany of my clients spent years developing a fully-functioning app with dozen of features without marketing and user feedback.  \nUnfortunately for some of them, this whole path was only to realize that product is not demanded by the market. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent for nothing (well, maybe for experience?).\n\nSwitch to high-quality code, advanced dev workflow, and multiple features when you got people's interest and some paying customers. But not earlier than it's needed.\nYou can have a big idea in your head, but for the initial release - try to cut off everything that you won't need in the first month. Some SaaS companies leave subscription/payment module implementation for after the release. They know that they'll have at least 30 days to implement it. And it's totally fine. Publish it lean, make it grow muscles, and become polished over time.\n\n![Not perfect](/img/blog/ship-it-today/not-perfect.webp)\n\n## When to build?\nI have a rule - \"Publish something today and improve it every day\". When this article is live, my website is half done and lacks a lot of features. But it's better to have a solid half than a shitty whole. \n\nDon't worry much, no one remembers when Google was published. Make yourself a 24h hackathon, develop a single-feature MVP, and just\n![Keep calm and ship it](/img/blog/ship-it-today/keep-calm-and-ship-it.webp)  \n**Thank you for reading!**\n\n<div class=\"well\">\n  <p>\n  This is my first blog post and I'm very excited about it! \uD83D\uDE0A Please share your feedback - it will help me improve my writing skills.
